Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 1; j * j < n; j *= 2) {
c++;
}
}

Solution :

Let us analyze how many times the inner loop will iterate. Let us see the values
of j for that.
J = 1, 2, 4, ... 2k
So 2^k * 2^k < n
So 2^(k+1) < n
So Time complexity becomes logN.
