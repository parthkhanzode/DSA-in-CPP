Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 1; j < n; j *= 2) {
c++;
}
}

Solution :
O(n log n) as the first loop ‘i’ will be iterated n times and the inner loop
will only traverse logn times so in total the overall time complexity becomes
O(nlogn).
