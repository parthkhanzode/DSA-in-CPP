Predict the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

Solution :
The program is correct and will compile but might result in runtime error.This is
because ptr will have a garbage address which might even point to a location which
does not belong to our program and hence might result in Segmentation Fault when we
are trying to access it.
