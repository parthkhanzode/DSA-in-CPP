Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.
int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
c +=i;
}

Solution :
O(n) as note here ‘i’ is being incremented by just 1 value so the loop will be
iterated n times only. Value of c is increasing but it has no effect on
iterations of loop.
